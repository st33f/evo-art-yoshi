"""
New version of evolution.py, which now evolves separate populations rather than one main.

Been thinking a bit about what selection etc actually means. In our implementation, there basically is no selection at
all, since we are using a generational model with a comma strategy. There is an equal number of offspring produced
to the amount of parents, which are all replaced (some offspring are left unmutated, but this is still technically
generational). Thus, no parent selection or survivor selection is enforced in the populations. Selection does come
into play for currently playing genes/phenes, but this is not technically evolutionary selection. The structure
could be changed to have survivor selection, for instance by producing a multitude of offspring and cutting a few
based on selection.

There's a bunch of redundancy in cloning offspring etc and the program works exactly the same without doing this (just
mutating the pop directly). I left it in because maybe in the future, it could be more interesting to generate more
offspring.

todo's
- could look a bit more at evolution strategy. Maybe adjust the parameters of .mutPolynomialBounded so a mutrate of
  1 guarantees mutation? This would be a bit more logical and enable more control.
- Update the evolution strategy to actually use survivor selection! The populations now are completely replaced by
  a similar amount of offspring. Over-producing offspring could generate more 'favourable' combinations prior to
  currently playing-selection.

- COULD experiment with 'demes', DEAP's preferred way of implementing multiple populations... but not required.
